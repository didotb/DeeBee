# DeeBee Bot: A Personal Discord Bot
DeeBee bot is a personal discord bot made as a self tutorial / introduction to python.

The bot is hosted and ran at **[Replit](https://replit.com/@ddotb/DeeBee "Replit")**

This is my way to learn and achieve many goals in using python.

### "Subcodes"
###### I like calling them subcodes
There are other python codes shipped with the main bot. Those are the `weather.py` and `dictionary.py`.

`weather.py`, as the name suggests, is a code that pulls weather images from **Himawari-8 Japanese Weather Satellite** and saves it as a 1-second long mp4 video file which the bot then sends to a discord server made for close friends.

`dictionary.py` has never been touched ever since it was made, I've been having problems formatting the JSON input from a website I'm getting from. However, I've been thinking of using **[spaCy](https://spacy.io/ "spaCy")** instead for multiple reasons.

`keep_alive.py` is simply a web server for **[UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/ "UptimeRobot")** to ping to. If the bot is offline, UptimeRobot sends me a message so I can check the console for problems, or updates.
